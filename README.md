# Flutter CallBack Demo

A Flutter project illustrating use of callbacks.

## ver2 branch(update)
Implemented the same app without using callback functions

## Getting Started

<del>Callback functions can be used to send data from one method to another, one widget to another.
Callbacks are passed a arguments to other functions.</del>

<del>In this app, a callback has been used to send data from a child widget to a parent widget.</del>

## App Description
<del>The app has two containers which swap colors, between blue and pink, when one is clicked.</del>

<del>When the container is clicked, a callback function is called, that assigns colors to both containers, depending on</del>
<del>current container color.</del>

<del>In the parent widget, where the callback is defined, it triggers a setState() method that re-renders the parent widget with the assigned colors.</del>
